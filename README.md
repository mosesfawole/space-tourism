### What I learned

This was a little bit challenging, but i scaled through haha, I'm most excited about some few things, probably not best practices , but i was glad i was able to thnik through and solve them :

- Firstly is the border-bottom to apply on based on the current page
- To show the mapped items by the index
- Body to take up background image of each page (really excited about this, all screen sizes has their background images, thanks to [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com))
